Thanks to the InterTech Community, 2016 was a hugely successful year with a large number of community driven events being held. On top of this, our participation at Pride in London was the largest yet.
   
   In 2017 we would like to deliver even more, and we need your help...
   
   We would like to open up InterTech, tapping into the enthusiasm and creativity of our community - and allowing each and every member to feel empowered to lead, create and organise their own events or socials. <b>By the community, for the community.</b>
   
   On the 12th Jan, we invite you to join us at BCG Digital Ventures (who have kindly offered us a room to run our co-creation session), to generate ideas and form teams. The evening will go as follows:
     
     18:45 - 19:00	Introduction
     19:00 - 20:00	Ideation and Team Discussion
     20:15 - 20:30	Q&amp;A and Lessons Learnt
     20:30 - Late	To the pub (We have booked an area at Archer Street W1D 7AP)
     
  <b>   If you'd like to come to the Co-Creation event, please make sure you <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/intertech-2017-co-creation-event-tickets-30961240905">sign up via EventBrite</a>.</b> As with all of our community events, there's no charge.
     
     If you cannot make it to the Co-Creation Event but want to join us at the pub, please feel free to join us later.
