InterTech and Softwire have arranged an evening with award winning actor/director Jake Graf showcasing Chance and Dawn, two of his recent short films. The screening is hosted by Softwire in their Camden offices and will be followed by a question and answer session with Jake and Kat Holmes, the producer of Dawn.<br ><br >This event is free to attend but we will be collecting donations on the night, which will go directly to fund the cost of Dawn, which was almost entirely self-funded. The suggested donations are £10 for members, £5 for students.
