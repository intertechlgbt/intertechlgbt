<i>Sorry! Tickets are now sold out for the event. </i>

</i>

InterTech &amp; Microsoft would like to invite you to a special networking (and ping-pong!) evening to kick off the Pride in London season. 

We have secured a private room at Bounce Farringdon (nearest tube: Chancery Lane) from 6.30pm til late. We'll have exclusive use of the ping pong tables in this room and a limited free bar! We'll have a brief hello from Microsoft's International Director of Diversity &amp; Inclusion and we hope to share more about our plans for the InterTech parade walking group. 

<i><b>Please note that registration is mandatory for this event.</b></i>
