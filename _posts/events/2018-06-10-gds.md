Join <b>Intertech LGBT+ Diversity Forum and the Government Digital Service (GDS)</b> this Pride Month for an evening of insight and learning around how an organisation, whose job is the digital transformation of the Government, are truly <b>embracing innovation and driving positive change</b>.

We'll hear from a number of speakers and see demonstrations of the technology behind GOV.UK Verify, their web platforms and much more - in addition we'll hear how <b>GDS are embracing diversity</b> and the importance of this to them.

There'll also be a chance for networking and a <b>Mario Kart Tournament</b> (Yes, you read that correctly...) afterwards, before in typical Intertech fashion we move to a nearby venue to continue the evening.

We look forward to seeing you there.
