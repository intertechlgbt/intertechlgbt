It's that time of year again and we're so excited to be taking part in the <b>Pride in London </b>parade thanks to our wonderful sponsors over at <b>Salesforce</b>, <b>TripAdvisor &amp; Accenture.</b>

We only have a <b>small number of tickets</b> for the parade this year, but that doesn't mean we don't want you to make any less noise or party atmosphere than previously. As ever we've t-shirts and goody bags so we'd love for you to come along, join the parade and celebrate one of our biggest events of the year with InterTech and friends.

Please <b>only sign up if you are certain you will take part in the parade</b>; we'd hate for someone to not be able to take part because a ticket has been assigned to someone who isn't going to come along.

If you're not able to get a ticket or instead want to watch the parade then sign-up for our <b>Pride Party with Salesforce</b> where we've plenty of availability and would be delighted to see you.
