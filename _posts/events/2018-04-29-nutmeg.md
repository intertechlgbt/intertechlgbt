Nutmeg is inviting Intertech members to their Vauxhall offices for a night of tech, diversity, fun and frivolity (aligned to your risk profile) - but don't worry, your capital is not at risk by attending this event!

We'll be hearing from three speakers on the topics of how immersive technologies are transforming our lives, why even your best ideas might not be actually that great, and of course we'll get an insight into how Nutmeg is using technology to transform it's business and engage with it's users.

Speakers on the evening will be:

Martin Stead, CEO of Nutmeg

Tom Hewitson, CEO of Labworks.io

Mark Stringer, Partner at Capco

Casey Lord, Product Manager at Nutmeg

We look forward to seeing you at what promises to be another great evening.
