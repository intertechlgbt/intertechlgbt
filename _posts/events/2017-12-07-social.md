Our last social event of 2017 will be held at the Big Chill Bar! Come and join us for one (or many) final beer(s) before people escape London for Christmas :)

It has been a whirlwind of a year for InterTech and we're so proud to be part of such a wonderful community. 

This year we have had some amazing events with some incredible partners including BCG, Visa, Microsoft, Imagination, Palantir, Google, Salesforce, The Institute of Directors, Capgemini, Capco, Goldman Sachs, Mozilla and BBC News! 

Together, we have created an amazing buzz around InterTech and we're really getting noticed across the London tech community! We have received a lot of interest from many companies wishing to partner with us so WATCH THIS SPACE in 2018 because we're only going to get BIGGER and BETTER :)

None of this is possible without the amazing volunteers who work in the background to get these events set up! We are always looking for more volunteers to support us, so if you want to get involved in working for an active and vibrant community please contact one of the admins! 

Alternatively join our private members group and post a message there or join our Slack channel!
