InterTech members have been invited to join the Cisco LGBT and Ally network for an evening of discussion about "The Power of Participation". 
  
  Diversity Role Models' patron and former NBA basketball player, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.johnamaechi.com/" rel="nofollow">John Amaechi</a>, will share his personal story of struggle and triumph and his perspective on the power of positive role models in sport and business. John works closely with Amnesty International on LGBT rights and often acts as a spokesperson on these issues. Dedicated to ensuring that the world of sport operates within a human rights ethos, John will illustrate that despite what we are often told, “<em>the most unlikely of people, in the most improbable of circumstances can become extraordinary – but to achieve this, we must be our authentic selves."</em>
      
    We will also be joined by American fitness expert and TV host, <a target="_blank" href="https://pavelka.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Jessie Pavelka</a>, who will share his thoughts on the power of role models in health and wellbeing. 
      
    But that’s not all – stay for drinks and canapés to continue the conversation with your peers.
