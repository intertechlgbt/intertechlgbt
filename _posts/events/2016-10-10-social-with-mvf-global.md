MVF Global (a tech start up in the customer acquisition space) have recently refurbished their new bar and cafe area and have kindly invited Intertech to come and have pizza/beer/non-alcoholic beverages on them! They are a fast growing start up and are keen to meet some like minded people who are:

1. Up for sharing pizza/beer/non-alcoholic beverages with them and have a great time. (Lets face it, based on past experience it will inevitably end with everyone going out in Soho)

2. Looking for marketing, data science, and programming roles in a start up environment

It has been while since we did something so this would be an amazing opportunity to see some old faces and new!
