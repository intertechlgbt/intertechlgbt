Join ThoughtWorks and InterTech in our Soho office on the 9th of August for a fireside discussion and networking with Joe Parslow: PhD Candidate; Visiting Lecturer at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama; cabaret producer; and drag queenâ€™s helping hand. Joe will be exploring the theme of building communities, specifically queer communities, as he takes us through a potted history of queer thinking to consider what queer might mean today, what it can do, and how we might use it.
