Now that Pride is gently coming to a close, the glitter has settled and everyone’s liver has had time to recover, Intertech and Paddle, a fast-growing software startup, are pleased to host a Q&amp;A session focused on discussing the topic of “Scaling Rapidly vs Hiring Inclusively” to keep up the momentum. 

As startups grow — often doubling and tripling in team size over a matter of months — a key challenge faced by entrepreneurs in the UK today is a lack of diversity as the overwhelming majority of companies at top-level management are white, British males that tend to hire people similar to them. 

Join us for an intimate and engaging discussion on this topic lead by startup leaders currently in the thick of this challenge:

Harrison Rose — CCO and Co-Founder of Paddle

Pierre Gaubert — Founder of myGwork

Sasha Scott - CEO and Founder of Inclusive Group

Together with the event attendees, we will have a candid Q&amp;A discussion with our speakers on how to tackle questions like <i>'How do you ensure gender balance esp. in historically male engineering teams?, What have you put in place in your selection processes to combat hiring bias?, What communication channels do you use to show people that your company lives up to its diversity promise? and Where do you know that you still have a lot more work to do and what are you planning to do about it?'</i>

Plenty of snacks and drinks will be provided throughout the event! Following the Q&amp;A, an open tab will be set up for attendees at the bar opposite the office for a casual get-together between you, our speakers and Paddlers.

To make for a lively discussion and cluster questions according to what topics you are most interested in, please submit a minimum of 1 question when you register. Of course, we’ll also allow for questions directly during the Q&amp;A.

<b>What is Paddle?</b>

We believe that software companies succeed when they can focus on building awesome products that the world loves and scale their business, rather than wasting time on building and maintaining everything that's required to run and grow. This is why hundreds of developers and software companies rely on our checkout and licensing solution to sell their products globally, as well as using our powerful analytics and marketing tools to understand and grow their businesses.

We’re early in our journey but making great progress: Deloitte Fast 50 named us the fastest growing software company in the UK (we’ve tripled revenue every year since our launch in 2012), and we’ve raised over $17m in funding from incredible investors such as Notion, BGF and Kindred.

<b>How To Register</b>

Please register for the event through Eventbrite. If you register but are unable to make the event, then please do cancel your ticket as there is limited space! To gather ideas on what you’re interested in, please submit 1 question you’d like to ask the speakers when you register.
