Intertech & Microsoft invite you to a <b>special networking (+ ping-pong!)</b> evening as we start to get ready for Pride in London season.

We have secured a private room at Bounce Farringdon (nearest tube: Chancery Lane) where we'll have exclusive use of the ping-pong tables in this room and <b>a limited free bar</b>! 

We'll have a brief hello from the Microsoft Diversity team who will share some of their plans for the year with us, then there'll be plenty of time for networking, while our Bounce ping-pong gurus bring out our competitive sides!

<b>Microsoft Employee, Customer or Friend?</b>
