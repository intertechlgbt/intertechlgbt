<b>What do you call a sheep with no legs? A cloud...</b>

For jokes better than this and an evening jam packed with laugh out loud funniness, join us at the <b>New Bloomsbury Set </b>on Wednesday evening courtesy of Comedy Bloomers, a diverse group of <b>LGBT+ comedians</b> who host regular stand up comedy nights throughout the year!

We've already over a <b>100 of you signed up to come along</b> so we're looking forward to a fantastic evening, further more tickets are available all the way up to the day of the event so if you find yourself free on the night, just sign up and come along.

<i>(...and if you are coming the venue is down the steps next to the little green door).</i>
