The LGBT &amp; Ally Community at Bloomberg, in partnership with Citi and State Street, invite InterTech members to join an intimate discussion on bisexuality to help raise awareness on what it means to be bisexual and to discuss some of the major prejudice, stigma and discrimination faced by the bisexual community.

<i>Bloomberg have invited several panellists from the LGBT community, who will help to demystify common preconceptions about bisexuality. They will also explore the stigmas associated to bisexual men and women in society and share their personal experiences. This event will offer the audience an opportunity to ask questions about bisexuality that they may not have had the chance to ask before.</i>
