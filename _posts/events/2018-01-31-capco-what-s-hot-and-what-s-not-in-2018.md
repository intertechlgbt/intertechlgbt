Join us on Thurs 8th Feb to <b>kick-off the new year</b> with a rundown on what's on the horizon for Intertech, our members and the ever changing tech sector that we live and work in.

With the topic of <b><i>'What's hot and what's not in 2018...'</i></b> we've pulled together a real spectrum of speakers who are eager to give their insight and opinions. 

Furthermore, we're inviting any of you to take to also take to the floor for a few informal minutes and tell us <b>what has got you excited for the year ahead?</b> Be it something you're working on, something you've seen or maybe just a hunch. Simply sign-up to attend as normal but also check the 'I've got something to share!' option if you want to contribute.

We're also delighted to once again be hosted by our friends over at <b><a href="https://www.capco.com/">Capco</a>, </b>who have very generously ensured that <b>drinks and pizza</b> will be in ample supply, and in typical Intertech fashion we'll extend an invite to all attending to join us afterwards in a venue to be confirmed.

So sign-up now for what promises to be an evening full of <b>insight, opportunity and a fantastic chance to catch-up</b> with your fellow Intertech members.
