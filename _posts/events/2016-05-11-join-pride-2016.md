InterTech represents the vibrant LGBT community in the UK tech and startup industry. This year we're back at London Pride, thanks to our fantastic sponsors Salesforce, Cisco, Medallia, Accenture, ThoughtWorks, TripAdvisor, Google and King.
  
  Due to new Pride rules, we are limited to 200 InterTech members in the march this year. However, we've got lots of t-shirts and goody bags, so we're inviting all members, friends and supporters to come along, collect your free goody bag and t-shirt and cheer us on. If there are extra spaces available on the day, you'll be welcome to join the parade.
    
  Looking forward to seeing you all there!
