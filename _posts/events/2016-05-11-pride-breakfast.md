InterTech, InterMedia and RoyaLGBT & Friends, the LGBT+ employee network of King, are hosting a pre-Pride celebration in King's very own magical Kingdom. We promise drinks, food and one of Londonâ€™s top DJs. Pretty much the perfect Pride warm-up.
      
    This is the hottest Pride ticket in town and spaces are limited, so book your ticket quickly!
    
    After the breakfast we'll be heading over to Portland Place to take part in the parade. Be sure to register for a place in our walking group in order to nab your very own t-shirt and goodie bag.
