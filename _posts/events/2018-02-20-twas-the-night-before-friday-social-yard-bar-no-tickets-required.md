<i>"Twas the night before Friday, when all through the office,

Not a person was working, not even Doris.

Where are they you ask, where can they be?

At the Intertech March Social of course! Where you should be!"</i>

Original work by Jerry Chen and coming to a GCSE English Literature anthology near you! Doris normally works very long hours but on Thursdays, she lets her hair down. 

You're invited to come an <b>join us and many more Intertech members</b> at Yard Bar in Soho and let your hair down with a drink (alcoholic or not!).

NO TICKETS OR SIGN-UP REQUIRED! :D
