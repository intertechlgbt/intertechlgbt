You're invited to join us at Palantir to for an <b>evening of insight and conversation</b> at their offices in Soho Square.

On the night , we'll hear from experts in data analytics in an open forum discussion of just some of the important issues affecting our community in the data-driven world and how we as members of the LGBT+ community can <b>help our organisations become a force for good in this space.</b>

The conversation will look at how <b>Pride is both a celebration of how far our community has come and a recognition of how far we have yet to go</b>, and the discussion will consider how the explosion of data collection and analytics in the last decade offers new opportunities to understand and improve our world - and new challenges to the fair treatment of the LGBT+ community.

Our future will be shaped not just in courtrooms and parliaments but in the decisions we make as engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, analysts, and all of us who make up the new data ecosystem.

Following the discussion you're invited to continue the conversation over <b>cocktails and canapés</b> with other Intertech members, friends and colleagues.

Spaces are limited so please make sure to RSVP if you’d like to attend.

We look forward to seeing you there.
