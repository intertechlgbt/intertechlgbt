We are excited to announce the next Intertech event in association with Deliveroo, to celebrate the start of Pride month. Join us on Deliveroo’s own basketball court for an evening of short talks and panel discussions.

<b>Short talks</b>

Three members of the Deliveroo tech team will take to the Roopitch to give short talks on topics ranging from <em>Diversity of personalities</em> to <em>How do you ask a machine a question?</em>

<b>Panel</b>

<em>Diversity: inclusive or exclusive?</em>

Next there will be a discussion with representatives from Deliveroo, Stonewall and Lloyds Bank around whether having specific diversity groups within a business actually promotes an inclusive, or exclusive culture.

<b>Food &amp; Drink</b>

In true Deliveroo style, plenty of food and drink (including alcohol free options) will be provided! If you have specific dietary requirements, please specify these when signing up.

<b>Register</b>
