Over the next few months we will invite InterTech members to create events, whether an informal social/networking event or perhaps an event run by an employer's LGBT network group and open to InterTech members. We will soon be creating a Facebook Group in which everyone can discuss what's next. In the meantime we are using the existing <a href="http://intertechlgbt.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8f58d5ef44e4a856353bbc2b3&id=23d30c9039&e=056e0c78c4" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> to promote these events.
  
  InterTech Member <em>Rob Farthing </em>has created the first informal event and advertised it on the Facebook Page. If you want to set up an event with us, <a href="mailto:info@intertechlgbt.com" target="_blank">drop us a mail.</a>
