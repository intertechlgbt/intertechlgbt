The IoD will mark the launch of the ‘Pride in Business Network’ amongst its membership with a drinks reception on the evening of July 7th, the eve of London’s famous Gay Pride March, at the IoD’s Headquarters on Pall Mall.

With LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs and business leaders now making waves in the business world, the IoD has partnered with other groups – InterTech, TechLondonAdvocates, Series Q and the Gay Women’s Network – to celebrate their achievements on this most festive of weekends.

The drinks will mark the beginning of the IoD’s Pride in Business series of networking events and mentoring, more details of which will be forthcoming in due course.
