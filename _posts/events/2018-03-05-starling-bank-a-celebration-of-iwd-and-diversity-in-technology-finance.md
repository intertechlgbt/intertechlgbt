In celebration of <b>Women's History Month</b>, Starling Bank and Intertech invite our members to join Starling Bank at their office to gain an insight into one of Londonâ€™s <b>HOTTEST Fintech start ups</b>! 

Learn more about Starling Bank's tech and app, as well as how they're <b>embracing diversity and women in technology</b>. This will be followed by a brief, informal and jovial discussion with Starling Bank where you're invited to ask all your burning questions. 

Food and drinks will be provided with vegetarian and non-alcoholic beverages too. 

Plus, if you fancy joining us a little later in the evening, we will be in a local watering hole after 9pm so feel free to join us then!
