Please join us for our summer and post-pride season<b> InterTech LGBT+ Forum retrospective</b>.

This will be a chance for you, our members, to join us in <b>reflecting on what we've done</b> over the summer period and <b>help shape what we take forward</b> for the rest of the year.

So come prepared with your thoughts, actions, and views and we'll have plenty of post-it notes, markers and paper available for the evening.

We're kindly being <b>hosted in Capgemini's office who will be providing soft drinks and nibbles</b> for the session.

<em>Please do ensure to register for the session as we require your names to be provided to Capgemini for entry to the building.</em>
