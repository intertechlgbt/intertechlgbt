<b>InterTech & Mozilla Festival</b> invite you to a networking event as part of<b> <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">MozFest 2017</a>.</b>

Mozilla is fueling the movement to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. The Internet's role in <b>economic opportunity, creativity, personal connection, free expression and democracy</b> around the world has made it a fundamental part of our modern lives. Yet today, censorship, surveillance, walled gardens and apathy are putting the open Internet at risk.

Join us in a safe space to <b>meet up, network and build the vital connections we need </b>to ensure we can work together to build a more open, respectful and inclusive web for everyone.

Join us for an evening at the <b>Royal Society of Arts</b>, as part of the <b>MozFest House </b>week of programming, see the <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/house">entire programme online</a>, to hear from speakers on the subject of <b>digital inclusion</b>; one of the major spaces in MozFest this year. The focus of the talks will be to promote ways we can <b>develop and promote safe spaces</b> on the internet which we hope will fuel the discussion for the rest of the evening.

If you'd like to attend <b>please sign-up on the link below</b> and take advantage of this incredible opportunity to network and learn from one another.
