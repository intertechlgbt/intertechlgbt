Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) is an annual observance held November 20 that honours the memory of those whose lives were lost in acts of anti-transgender violence. 
 
 To mark this event, Barclays Spectrum, the staff led LGBT network for Barclays employees, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, a leading international law firm are hosting an evening in support of Mermaids UK, a charity that supports children or young people up to 19 years old suffering from gender identity issues and their families.
