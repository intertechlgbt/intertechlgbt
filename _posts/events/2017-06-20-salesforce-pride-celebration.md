We're excited to be invited to join <b>Salesforce </b>for their Pride in London celebrations at Archer Street Bar, taking place just minutes away from Piccadilly Circus, a perfect spot to watch the parade.

Itâ€™s time to <b>come together and celebrate diversity</b>, whether you're a member of InterTech, Salesforce, the LGBTQ community, a straight ally or anyone else - you're welcome.

Following the parade, those marching with InterTech will re-unite with us further celebrations and to continue to party into the evening.

We have <b>12 tables reserved</b> outside of Archer Street and an area inside reserved too; use of the venue's facilities and what promises to be an entertaining day with performances, on <b>Archer Street Bar's very own stage</b>, from great names in the West End and more.

<b>Spaces are limited so please only register is you are certain you can attend. </b>

Wristbands for the bar and food will only be issued to those who have registered online.
