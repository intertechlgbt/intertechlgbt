We're delighted to invite you to join us for a <b>LGBT+ Startup networking event</b> with Google Campus to meet like minded <b>entrepreneurs, makers and their supporters</b> in this space.

Whether you identify as LGBT+, or simply wish to support the cause while enjoying an evening full of rainbows, we want everyone to join the celebration!

We really do want to make this evening as engaging and worthwhile for members who are<b> entreprenuers, working in start-ups, makers and investors</b>, so if you do fit into one of these groups please sign-up as we'd love to see you there.

We're also delighted to have individuals from <b>Gayglers, Lesbians Who Tech and the Gay Womens Network</b> joining us.

In typical fashion there will be drinks and nibbles, plus music and some amazing connections waiting for you on the evening - as well as post-event celebrations in a nearby venue.

See you there!
