InterTech members have been invited to join Bloomberg's LGBT & Ally Community for this exclusive event featuring our guest speaker, acclaimed author, Andrew Hodges, who will focus his talk on Alan Turing.
 
 In his short life, the British mathematician Alan Turing became the founder of modern computer science and the leading scientific figure in the Allied breaking of German ciphers in World War 2. He was also a gay man who was prosecuted under the British criminal law in 1952.
 
 Andrew Hodges will describe the connection between these aspects of Alan Turingâ€™s life and the background to his death in 1954.
