The increasingly isolationist policies of the UK, US and other Western powers have wrought severe repercussions on the global LGBTIQ community. Earlier this month, an emboldened Russia rounded up and tortured over 100 gay men. Late last year, the President of Gambia vowed to personally slit the throats of gay Gambians. And closer to home, hate crimes against LGBTIQ people are on the rise.

Please join the London Young Professionals Engagement Committee as we host Jessica Stern, the Executive Director of OutRight Action International, for a discussion on the future of LGBTIQ human rights - at home and abroad - as we enter this new populist era. Jessica will be joined by two grassroots activists who will highlight the challenges they face fighting for the LGBTIQ community in their home countries, as well as the role that the international community can play in supporting them.

The evening will kick off at 7pm with an hour of unlimited Pimm's for all guests. Come by for a drink before heading out for the evening, meet like-minded professionals and students, and learn what you can do to support LGBTIQ human rights at home and abroad. 100% of your Â£15 entry goes directly to OutRight Action International, the world's leading LGBTIQ human rights charity.
