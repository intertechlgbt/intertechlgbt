Join us for an evening of conversation, questions and insight with <b><a href="http://midrive.com/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://midrive.com/">Midrive</a> </b>and <a href="http://crowdcube.com/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://crowdcube.com/"><b>Crowdcube</b></a> considering how both businesses have scaled from small tech start-ups to successful multi-million pound marketplaces.

We'll be hearing from Asher Ismail, Midrive CEO (and Intertech royalty, having co-founded Intertech in 2012).

In the last 12 months, sales of Midrive’s ‘smarter lessons’ and ‘pay as you go’ insurance have increased 391%. Asher will be sharing his<b> top lessons</b> for scaling a marketplace business (and the necessary technology), with examples from Uber, eBay, and AirBnb, as well as some mistakes he's made along the way as an entrepreneur.

We'll also be joined by Darren Mulvihill of Crowdcube who will share the challenges they have overcome in creating the <b>UK’s largest crowdfunding marketplace</b>.

In typical Intertech fashion, drinks and canapés will be provided and we'll continue the evening, and conversation, in a nearby venue afterwards.

See you there,

Intertech Team
