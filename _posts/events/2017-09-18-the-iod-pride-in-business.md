<b>An announcement...</b>

We're delighted to share with you the exciting news that <b>InterTech has aligned with 'The IoD'</b><b> (The Institute of Directors)</b> to support<b> </b>LGBTQ+ business leaders to network, share information and stories and do business with like-minded individuals. InterTech, working alongside<b> <a href="http://www.techlondonadvocates.org.uk/">TechLondonAdvocates</a>, <a href="http://seriesq.com/">Series Q</a> </b>and the <a href="http://www.gwn.org.uk/"><b>Gay Women’s Network</b></a> all sit on the IoD Pride in Business committee supporting the IoD's Royal Charter of 1906 to support its members.

<b>An invitation...</b>
