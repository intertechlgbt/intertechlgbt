One of the things we've always been keen to do is create a space where members of the LGBT+ tech community can openly network, forge connections and support one another. Live events are great for this, but not everyone can make them, so we're going to give a facebook Group a try.
     
 The  group is a place to share stories about LGBT+ and tech. It's a place to ask questions about your career or seek out other members who might be able to assist in it. It's a place to post job vacancies or seek freelancers or promote your services to the community. It's a place to arrange socials and generally be a bit silly and have a bit of fun.
     
 Who knows how it will evolve. They key thing is that we all share a common bond, so introduce yourself, support one another and play nicely!
