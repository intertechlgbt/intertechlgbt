<b>What if I missed out on a ticket? ðŸ˜¨</b>

We anticipate that Pride tickets will be very popular, however fear not! Sign up for our waitlist on the second ticket release and we will keep you in the loop about our Pride activities. On the day of Pride, if you are planning to visit London and would like the chance to join the parade, please bring your wonderful self and your waitlist ticket to our parade meeting point for the chance to win tickets from no-shows in our raffle! We will try and match you with your T-shirt size but unfortunately this cannot be guaranteed - whatever size of T-shirt, we are sure that something ðŸ¦„FABULOUS ðŸ¦„ can be created from it!
