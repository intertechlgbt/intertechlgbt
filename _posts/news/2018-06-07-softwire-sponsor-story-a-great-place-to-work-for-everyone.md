Softwire are sponsoring Intertech LGBT+ Diversity Forum as one of our <a href="https://prideinlondon.org/">Pride in London 2018</a> sponsors. 

<i><b>We've therefore asked them to share with you, our members, what diversity inclusion means to Softwire and why they've chosen to work with us and support you all in celebrating Pride with Intertech this year...</b></i>

Softwire is a London based software development company delivering bespoke software solutions and applications for some of the UKâ€™s leading brands, and they were delighted to share with us why they truly do value '<i>a diverse workforce and the contribution each individual makes</i>'. 

Just like the objectives of Intertech, they are committed to promoting inclusivity, equality and diversity in their policies, practices and procedures, and to '<i>ensuring that no one feels left out as they work hard to create an inclusive working environment which allows people to simply be themselves at work</i>'

It goes without saying that Softwire believes in treating everyone equally and with the same attention, courtesy and respect, and that diverse and inclusive companies make for more innovative, engaged, and happy teams. <i>'Softwire is a great place to work for everyone, this has been reflected in our position in the top <a href="https://appointments.thetimes.co.uk/article/best100companies/">25 Sunday Times Best Small Companies</a> for the past 8 years.'</i>

We know that we're looking forward to marching with Softwire this year and having heard about the vibrant social scene and numerous LGBT+ themed events that they host we're sure it'll be a carnival atmosphere.
