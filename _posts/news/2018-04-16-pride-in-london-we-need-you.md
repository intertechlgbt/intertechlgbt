The <b>Pride in London Parade</b> is held annually to celebrate progress made in the LGBT+ community towards equality and remind us of the of the ongoing LGBT+ issues not just in London but all over the world. 

This year, Intertech will once again be joining in the festivities with a "SHEDLOAD"(technical term) of events from our sponsors, on the day activities and more Intertech members marching than before.

<b>Intertech Pride 2018 promises to be the bigger and better than ever before!</b>

Over the coming months, we will be sharing more details, however for now we need some key support from the Intertech community to help make this happen. This will include low key activities (i.e. attending weekly calls, taking a few actions) and potentially on the day tasks to help the day run smoothly. We respect the time and capacity of our volunteers so we'll <b>guarantee you a marching ticket</b> to say thank you.

If you are interested in helping out over the coming months, please drop jerr2y.chen@gmail.com or rfarthing@outlook.com an email and we will take it from there!
