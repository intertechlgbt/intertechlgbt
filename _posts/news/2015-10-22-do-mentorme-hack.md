What happened the last time Intertech got together at Campus, a Google space to work on the MentorMe platform? 

We had many ideas, some disruptive, some worth gold, and all them discussed! Finalisation of all the page flows, and being *THIS* close to getting over the last technical hurdles to get a working page/linked-in working in Node.js

We also managed to get some great feedback from several of the participants on how a few changes could really help streamline the next session. 

Many thanks for all the contributions and conversations!
