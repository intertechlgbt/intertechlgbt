One of our long standing supporters and an organisation that is close to our hearts, Capco are sponsoring Intertech LGBT+ Diversity Forum as one of our <a href="https://prideinlondon.org/">Pride in London 2018</a> sponsors. 

<i><b>We know they're an organisation truly embracing what it means to support diversity and inclusion, but we still wanted to share with you, our members, what diversity and inclusion means at Capco, and why they're supporting you all in celebrating Pride with Intertech this year...</b></i>

Capco has a very strong relationship with Intertech having co-hosted a number of events in the past and being truly proud to support LGBTQ+ members in the industry. 

As a global business and technology consultancy focused on financial services, they believe that '<i>true inclusion is about fostering an environment where all employees can be themselves at work' </i>and their <a href="https://www.capco.com/About-Us/Our-Culture-and-Values/Be-yourself-at-work">#BeYourselfAtWork networks</a>, sponsored by the firm, are an integral part of their culture and progress on diversity.

On daily basis, they told us that they celebrate individuality and believe:

<ul><li><i>everyone should be proud of and open about who they are, and challenge stereotypes;

</i></li><li><i>everyone has a right at be safe at work, and to bring their whole self to work;

</i></li><li><i>everyone has the opportunity to mix and celebrate what they have in common as well as their differences.</i></li></ul>We simply couldn't agree more... and we're so pleased that Capco will join us once again this year to further demonstrate their visible commitment to diversity and inclusion.
