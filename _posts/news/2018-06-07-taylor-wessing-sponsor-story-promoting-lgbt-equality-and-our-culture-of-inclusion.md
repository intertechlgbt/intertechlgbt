With over 1100 lawyers in 32 offices around the world, Taylor Wessing are a leading full-service international law firm, and an organisation that we're delighted are sponsoring Intertech LGBT+ Diversity Forum as one of our <a href="https://prideinlondon.org/">Pride in London 2018</a> sponsors. 

<i><b>We've asked them to share with you, our members, what diversity and inclusion means to Taylor Wessing, and why they've chosen to work with us and support you all in celebrating Pride with Intertech this year...</b></i>

<i>'Creating an inclusive working environment and recognising the value our people bring to Taylor Wessing is at the heart of our culture; it's what makes Taylor Wessing a great place to work.</i>' is a rather perfect way of explaining why Taylor Wessing has committed to sponsoring Intertech and why we're so pleased to have them join us at Pride in London 2018. 

As an orgasniation '<i>working with clients in the most dynamic industries helping them succeed by thinking innovatively about their business issues</i>' their '<i>focus on the industries of tomorrow has enabled them to develop market-leading expertise in Life Sciences, Private Wealth and Technology, Media and Communications</i>', but this hasn't stopped them pushing forwards in ensuring that diversity and inclusion remain core to their business, as the following illustrates.

As a <a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/full-list-top-100-employers-2018">Stonewall Top 100 employer</a>, Taylor Wessing clearly champion LGBT+ inclusion and have therefore become a market leader in diversity initiatives. When we asked them why Intertech? They told us, '<i>We are proud to sponsor Intertech at Pride London 2018. Technology is one of the youngest and yet, one of the fastest growing sectors. Our support represents our shared values and our commitment to improving LGBT equality.'</i>

We were also lucky to hear directly from Sian Skelton, Diversity & Inclusion Partner, who stated,'<i>We are committed to promoting LGBT equality and our culture of inclusion to extend beyond the firm to the wider community. As Diversity & Inclusion Partner, and a tech lawyer, I am delighted that we are sponsoring Intertech at Pride this year.'</i>

If all of the above doesn't paint a picture of just how supportive Taylor Wessing are both of Intertech, the LGBT+ community and of ensuring diversity and inclusion remains a constant stream in their business; then we're not sure what else would...
