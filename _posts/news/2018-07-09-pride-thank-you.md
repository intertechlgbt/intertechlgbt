This weekend saw the end of a month of pride celebrations at the <b>Pride in London 2018</b> march surrounded by over 150 fabulous Intertech members, friends and family!

Photos will follow shortly but Rob Farthing, our Pride &amp; Engagement Lead, wanted to take a moment to thank the wonderful people who have all contributed significantly during the last half year of planning.

<i>"We've hosted nearly 1,000 members at 7 pride events in the last month, finishing with our biggest pride march ever. All of this wouldn't have been possible without the amazing support of Team Pride. Jerry, Nick, David, James, Kevin, Michael, Eralp, Chris, Koen and of course, our volunteers yesterday too Melanie Olsen, Jean-Yves, John, Rory and Paul."</i>

Thank you to all of the team, our members and sponsors for another fantastic Pride.
