Following previous efforts to develop a mentoring platform, we revisited the idea in our January Co-Creation event. The output from the event was a sketch of a mentoring scheme aiming to enable our members better connect and share experiences. 

Since then, Colin, one of our members, has been working with <a href="http://www.werkinapp.com/">WERKIN</a>, which is led by an LGBT+ entrepreneur, to make this a reality and we're delighted to say we’re now ready to run a trial of "InterTech mentoring” to gauge interest and assess the potential value to the community. Participants will have access to a mobile app designed to make mentoring more time efficient and productive, particularly where mentor and mentees span companies and locations. 

<b><i>Are you interested? </i></b> We would appreciate you filling in your details <a href="https://werkin.typeform.com/to/XQDaj8">on this Typeform</a> (7 questions only, promise!) to understand what you would hope to get out of a mentoring relationship. We'll then feed back once we've heard from everyone who's interested.

<i>Editor's note: In this beta stage the organisers have created an iOS compatible app only. We will share news of other platforms soon. </i>
