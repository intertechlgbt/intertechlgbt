For the last couple of years, we have broadly had 3 types of InterTech Event:
  
  <ul><li>InterTech:DO - <em>A chance to volunteer your skills and time to develop coll tech projects to make stuff better. For the past year the teams have been developing a mentoring platform. </em></li><li>InterTech:TALK - <em>A networking event with a lecture session on a topic relevant to the LGBT+ Tech community. Typically sponsored by a company. </em></li><li>InterTech:MEET - <em>A social/networking event with a fun element (ping pong and console gaming sessions for example).</em></li></ul>We are temporarily suspending this structure for now. We hope to start again later in the year. If you want to get involved and develop any of these strands (or a type we haven't thought of yet) please <a href="mailto:info@intertechlgbt.com" target="_blank">get in touch.</a>
