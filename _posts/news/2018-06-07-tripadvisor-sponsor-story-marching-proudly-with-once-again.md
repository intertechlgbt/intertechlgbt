Since 2016, TripAdvisor have supported Intertech with our Pride activities, and once again this year they'll be marching proudly with colleagues across the technology industry in London. It goes without saying, that they're also sponsoring Intertech LGBT+ Diversity Forum as one of our <a href="https://prideinlondon.org/">Pride in London 2018</a> sponsors. 

<i><b>We've asked them to share with you, our members, what diversity and inclusion means to TripAdvisor, and why they've chosen to work, once again, with us and support you all in celebrating Pride with Intertech this year...</b></i>

<i>'As the world's largest travel site*, TripAdvisor enables travellers to unleash the full potential of every trip. With over 630 million reviews and opinions covering the world's largest selection of travel listings worldwide – covering approximately 7.5 million accommodations, airlines, experiences, and restaurants – TripAdvisor provides travellers with the wisdom of the crowds to help them decide where to stay, how to fly, what to do and where to eat.'</i>

This rather impressive intro to TripAdvisor, shows the real benefits that can be achieved when we stand together, and at TripAdvisor we were delighted to hear that they '<i>are deeply committed to our value of being "Better Together". We stand with our employees who are part of the LGBTQ+ community and are proud to support local participation in global Pride events.'</i>

For the past few years, TripAdvisor teams have taken part in Pride parades around the world to show their pride and ally-ship. This year, we're looking forward to continuing the tradition TripAdvisor established in 2016 marching proudly with us and in their words <i>'We can't wait to celebrate with you all!'.</i>
