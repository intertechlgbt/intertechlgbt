myGwork, the global LGBT+ social recruitment platform will be joining us to march in this years Pride in London parade. They are also very kindly sponsoring Intertech LGBT+ Diversity Forum as one of our <a href="https://prideinlondon.org/">Pride in London 2018</a> sponsors. 

<i><b>As an organisation built around championing diversity, we know they're really passionate about diversity and inclusion, but we still went ahead and asked them to share with you, our members, what diversity inclusion means to myGwork and why they've chosen to work with us and support you all in celebrating Pride with Intertech this year...</b></i>

myGwork, the LGBT+ and allies business community, is the global LGBT+ social recruitment platform that helps candidates identify inclusive employers, network, find mentors, learn about professional LGBT+ news, and engage in LGBT+ & D&I events. You can check out their promotional video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hI_-ZvXSA8&t=5s">here</a>.

For that reason, they told us that they '<i>want to contribute to building a global workforce that champions diverse organisations and give better employment & networking opportunities to the LGBT+ community. As an LGBT+ tech company, we are very excited to support Intertech and march together at Pride in London 2018. Together, we are empowered!'</i>
