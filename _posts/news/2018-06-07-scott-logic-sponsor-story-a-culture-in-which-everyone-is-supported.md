Scott Logic, the friendly people building brilliant software, are sponsoring Intertech LGBT+ Diversity Forum as one of our <a href="https://prideinlondon.org/">Pride in London 2018</a> sponsors. 

<i><b>We've asked them to share with you, our members, what diversity and inclusion means to Scott Logic, and why they've chosen to work with us and support you all in celebrating Pride with Intertech this year...</b></i>

<i>'At Scott Logic, we constantly strive to build an open and inclusive environment. As a people-focused technology consultancy, we pride ourselves on creating a culture in which everyone is supported to reach their full potential, whatever their background or identity. We are extremely pleased to be sponsoring Intertech for Pride in London 2018, and look forward to seeing you there!'</i>

It's short and to the point but we're really looking forward to seeing Scott Logic there too!
